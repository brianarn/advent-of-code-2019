# Advent of Code 2019

Trying this again, woo

Honestly this is kind of a fork/clone/update of my [2017 take on things](https://github.com/brianarn/advent-of-code-2017) because I enjoyed how that felt like it was going.

I'm not trying to learn anything new so much, just ... trying to get back into coding again.
